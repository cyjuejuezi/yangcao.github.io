Project Experience
======
###Periodicity-Driven Contact-free Heartbeat Rate Estimation Based on IR-UWB Technology
* Proposed a method for extracting contact-free human heartbeat rate based on IR-UWB autocorrelation matrix feature mapping；
* As the first inventor, a patent ‘A contact-free human heartbeat waveform extraction Method’ has been authorized; 
* As the first author, I presented the short paper  ‘UWHeart: Periodicity-Driven Contact-free Heartbeat Rate Estimation Based on IR-UWB Technology’ at BIBM 2024​​ (CCF-B Conference).

###Benchmarking Computational Methods for Emerging Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction
* Proposed a benchmark for drug-drug interaction prediction, to systematically evaluate model robustness against chemical space distribution shifts via controlled simulations;
* Conducted data partitioning in real scenarios and completed the verification of DDI task distribution shifts in real scenarios.
* As the second author, our paper titled ‘Benchmarking Computational Methods for Emerging Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction’ has been submitted to Neurips 2025 （CCF-A Conference）
