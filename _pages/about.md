I am a student in the Tsinghua University-Johns Hopkins University Dual Master's Degree Program. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from the Honors College of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.  

From my sophomore to junior year, I worked under the supervision of Prof. Fu Xiao, focusing on research in deep learning-based recovery of human vital signs. I gained in-depth practical experience through the project on non-contact human vital sign detection using IR-UWB. This work resulted in a first-author paper published in the BIBM conference (CCF-B) and an authorized first-author invention patent.

During my senior year, I joined a research project on "Benchmarking Computational Methods for Emerging Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction" under the guidance of Prof. Quanming Yao at Tsinghua University. In this project, I was responsible for the code implementation and the creation of figures for the paper. The resulting paper was submitted to NeurIPS (CCF-A) with me as the second author.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in various academic competitions and won more than ten national and provincial awards.  These include a Meritorious Mention Award of the U.S. College Student Mathematical Modeling Contest, a National Second Prize in the National English Competition for College Students, a National Third Prize in the Asia and Pacific Mathematical Contest in Modeling, and a Third Prize in the National College Student Mathematics Competition. I have strong programming, debugging, and self-learning skills.
