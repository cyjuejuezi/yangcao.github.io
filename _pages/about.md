I am currently a graduate student in the **Tsinghua University - Johns Hopkins University Dual Master's Degree Program**. I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from the Honors College of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My advisor at Tsinghua University is [Quanming Yao](https://lars-group.github.io/).

**Recent Updates (Fall 2025 at JHU):**
I have just completed my first semester at Johns Hopkins University, establishing a rigorous foundation in computational methods. I am pleased to share my academic performance in core graduate courses:
* **EN.530.641 Statistical Learning For Engineers:** A+
* **EN.553.636 Introduction to Data Science:** A+
* **EN.601.682 Machine Learning: Deep Learning:** A

During my senior year, I joined the project "Benchmarking Computational Methods for Emerging Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction" under the guidance of Prof. Quanming Yao at Tsinghua University. I was responsible for code implementation and figure creation, specifically designing data partitioning schemes to simulate chemical space distribution shifts. This experience was pivotal, grounding me in **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and the critical challenge of **out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization**. My contributions to this work were recognized in the acknowledgments of the final manuscript.

Prior to this, from my sophomore to junior year, I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Fu Xiao](https://yjs.njupt.edu.cn/dsgl/nocontrol/college/dsfcxq.htm?dsJbxxId=9B9D05C52A832DCFE050007F01006EFE), focusing on deep learning-based recovery of human vital signs. I gained in-depth practical experience through a project on contact-free human vital sign detection using IR-UWB radar. This work led to a **first-author paper** at the IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (**BIBM 2024**, CCF-B) and a **first-author invention patent** for the novel methods developed.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in various academic competitions and won more than ten national and provincial awards. These include a **Meritorious Mention** in the U.S. College Student Mathematical Modeling Contest (MCM/ICM), a **National Second Prize** in the National English Competition for College Students, and awards in the Asia and Pacific Mathematical Contest in Modeling and the National College Student Mathematics Competition. I possess strong skills in programming, debugging, and self-directed learning.
